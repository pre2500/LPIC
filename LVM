LVM - Logical volume management

Before creating Logical volumes we would need to know create other things.

Step 1 - Create physical volumes from raw devices or block devices.

[centos@sbphcdg175-usw2 ~]$ lsblk
NAME    MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
xvda    202:0    0  40G  0 disk 
└─xvda1 202:1    0  40G  0 part /

the above output shows there is one block device attached to the instance and that one device is also partioned as xvda1.
lsblk output shows devices whether they are mounted or not.

mount command should devices that are mounted.
for eg:
[centos@sbphcdg175-usw2 ~]$ mount | grep /dev/xvda1
/dev/xvda1 on / type xfs (rw,relatime,seclabel,attr2,inode64,noquota)
/dev/xvda1 on /var/lib/docker/containers type xfs (rw,relatime,seclabel,attr2,inode64,noquota)
/dev/xvda1 on /var/lib/docker/overlay2 type xfs (rw,relatime,seclabel,attr2,inode64,noquota)
