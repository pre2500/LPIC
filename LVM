LVM - Logical volume management

Before creating Logical volumes we would need to know create other things.

Step 1 - Create physical volumes from raw devices or block devices.

[centos@sbphcdg175-usw2 ~]$ lsblk
NAME    MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
xvda    202:0    0  40G  0 disk 
└─xvda1 202:1    0  40G  0 part /

the above output shows there is one block device attached to the instance and that one device is also partioned as xvda1.
lsblk output shows devices whether they are mounted or not.

mount command should devices that are mounted.
for eg:
[centos@sbphcdg175-usw2 ~]$ mount | grep /dev/xvda1
/dev/xvda1 on / type xfs (rw,relatime,seclabel,attr2,inode64,noquota)
/dev/xvda1 on /var/lib/docker/containers type xfs (rw,relatime,seclabel,attr2,inode64,noquota)
/dev/xvda1 on /var/lib/docker/overlay2 type xfs (rw,relatime,seclabel,attr2,inode64,noquota)

Creating Physical Volumes and Volume Groups
---> In order to follow on the lecture you need to install 
yum install lvm2

lsblk will display the disk and partitions. we will create physical volumes using pvcreate command.

pvcreate <partition_name>
pvcreate /dev/nvme1n1p1
pvcreate /dev/nvme1n1p2

Display's all the created physical volumes
1 - pvs 
2 - pvdisplay

Command to create volume groups
vgcreate test_vg /dev/nvme1n1p1 /dev/nvme1n1p2

Display's all the created physical volumes
1 - vgs 
2 - vgdisplay

Command to extend created volume groups
vgextend test_vg /dev/nvme1n1p3

Command to extend rename volume groups
vgextend test_vg dev_vg

Command to extend remove volume group
vgextend test_vg dev_vg
