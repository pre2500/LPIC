Linux based distributions
1 - Ubuntu --> choice for desktop Linux
2 - centos7 ---> free and based on RHEL Enterprise Linux
3 - Debian
4 - RHEL --> If money is there make use of it
5 - Fedora

---------------------------
GPG
---------------------------
GPG is used to exchange encrypted files between two systems. We will need a private and a public key.

Any key generating system depends upon an concept called as ENTROPY in order to generate a key. 
The complexity of the key depends upon how much random data
it is aware of in order to generate the key. So for a new system that has been launched you will have very less random data.

rngd utility is used to generate random numbers and increase the entropy as the default entropy will be slow as it pulls data from only hardware
devices (location --> /dev/random)





---------------------------
SSH
---------------------------
ssh parent configurations are present in ----> /etc/ssh/ssh_config

under every user folder there is .ssh directory which will have known_hosts

ssh-keygen will generate a strong 2048 bit length key pair and RSA encryption
if you want to customize the key gen preparation then 
ssh-keygen -b 1024 -t DSA. ---> do not use this 1024 bit length as it is a weaker key

Enter passphrase for an option ---> this will allow multi factor authentication , highly secure environments will utlize this..

id_rsa ---> will stay on the system that was created and we will not share it with anyone.
id_rsa.pub  ---> will be the key that is copied over to the remote system

know_hosts ---> when we make a remote connection with a key pair this file will be populated with the fingerprint of the remote system.

ssh-copy-id ---> will copy over the public key to another system

authorized_keys is a file that will be present on a system that will have the list of public keys that 
it will accept in order to provide a successful remote connection.

how to avoide the passphrase while logging in ?
add the ssh-add wrapper and add the keypair so that you are not asked for the passphrase once again.

ssh -X --> enables X11 forwarding
ssh -x --> disables X11 forwarding
X11 forwarding is only used when there is a graphical user interface.
