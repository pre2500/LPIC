ssh parent configurations are present in ----> /etc/ssh/ssh_config

under every user folder there is .ssh directory which will have known_hosts

ssh-keygen will generate a strong 2048 bit length key pair and RSA encryption
if you want to customize the key gen preparation then 
ssh-keygen -b 1024 -t DSA. ---> do not use this 1024 bit length as it is a weaker key

Enter passphrase for an option ---> this will allow multi factor authentication , highly secure environments will utlize this..

id_rsa ---> will stay on the system that was created and we will not share it with anyone.
id_rsa.pub  ---> will be the key that is copied over to the remote system

know_hosts ---> when we make a remote connection with a key pair this file will be populated with the fingerprint of the remote system.

ssh-copy-id ---> will copy over the public key to another system

authorized_keys is a file that will be present on a system that will have the list of public keys that 
it will accept in order to provide a successful remote connection.

how to avoide the passphrase while logging in ?
add the ssh-add wrapper and add the keypair so that you are not asked for the passphrase once again.

ssh -X --> enables X11 forwarding
ssh -x --> disables X11 forwarding
X11 forwarding is only used when there is a graphical user interface.
