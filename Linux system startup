The goal of the Linux Standard Base (LSB) is to develop and promote a set of standards and guidelines to promote compatibility between Linux operating systems

1 - What is a Linux standard base ? --> It is a join project by Linux foundation and various other linux distributions based on POSIX (Portable operating system interface)

2 - What are the areas of standardization by the Linux foundations? --> Standard Libraries , File system layout , common utitlities , run levels , Boot facilities.
backward compatibilites.

SysVinit is an initialization process for Linux systems that begins with a single process, init, which subsequently spawns all other processes on the system. This is a old
process and most of the recent versions have moved to systemd.

if you want to check the various run levels provided by sys-init , you have to go to /etc/iniitab ... this file is not being used in the modern version of systemd.

Diff run levels
0 - hault (never use this)
1 - single user mode
2 - multiuser mode with NFS
3 - full multiuser mode 
4 - unused
5 - X11
6 - reboot

What is the first script that gets called out as part of boot up ?

The init.d directory contains initialization scripts for all the services on our system. 
These scripts can be called to stop and start a service, and can be modified to enable or disable a service for a specific runlevel. 
Based on the run levels configured it goes to /etc/rc.d and excuted the files in the directory based on the configured run levels

[centos@sbphcdg175-usw2 rc.d]$ ls -ltr
total 4
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 473 Apr 11  2018 rc.local
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root  84 Jul  2  2020 init.d
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root  62 Jul  2  2020 rc5.d
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root  62 Jul  2  2020 rc4.d
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root  62 Jul  2  2020 rc3.d
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root  62 Jul  2  2020 rc2.d
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root  62 Jul  2  2020 rc1.d
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root  62 Jul  2  2020 rc0.d
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root  62 Jul  2  2020 rc6.d

For example if I navigate to one of the run level directories I will be able to find out what are the system services that will start or stop 
based on the K or the S links

[centos@sbphcdg175-usw2 rc.d]$ cd rc3.d/
[centos@sbphcdg175-usw2 rc3.d]$ ls -ltr
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 20 May 16  2018 K50netconsole -> ../init.d/netconsole
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 17 May 16  2018 S10network -> ../init.d/network
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 16 Jul  2  2020 S90splunk -> ../init.d/splunk

Here the K links will be killed and S links will be started.

How to modify the run levels ?
